Clean the workspace directory
In some occasions, deleting the Java Language Server workspace directory is helpful to go back to a clean slate. Generally speaking, on the different platforms, the VS Code user workspace storage area can be found under these locations :

Windows : %APPDATA%\Code[ - Variant]\User\workspaceStorage\
MacOS : $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code[ - Variant]/User/workspaceStorage/
Linux : $HOME/.config/Code[ - Variant]/User/workspaceStorage/
